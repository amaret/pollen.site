here is what isn't done:

The support page has nothing in it. Needs forum, obvs.

'about' on the top nav-bar does not link to an info page on amaret. 

There is no info anywhere on how to download either pollec client or the pollen
bundles. 
  A grep on 'download' will turn up places where the download link for the
  bundles could be added 

There is nothing here related to docker, using or installing.
  (if alpha is docker, why are we calling it a cloud compiler? 
   I'm concerned that the docker install will be discouraging.)

The examples translate to localhost as well as specific targets. BUT the localhost
compiles get c compiler errors. This didn't use to happen I think some bijou
code migrated here in an incomplete fashion. 

The cloud compiler page has unimplemented sections that I have left in place:
Reports, Analytics, Export.


Other stuff that needs to be done, non-doc:

bundles need a scrubbing. 
license needs to be inserted for bundles, eg. bsd or whatev.
