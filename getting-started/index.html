  <p>We will quickly walk you through the steps to get your first pollen program compiled and running!</p>

  <h1 class="page-header">The Program</h1>
  <p>The canonical "Hello, World!" program for hardware applications, blinking an Led. This highly efficient version is not your typical infinte loop-delay blink. This one makes use of an event based timer which toggles an Led periodically and allows the system to do other things in the interm, or if there is nothing to be done, go into a low-power mode, saving power.</p>
    <pre><code>import pollen.environment as MyBoard
from MyBoard import Led
  
from pollen.time import Timer
  
module Blink {
  
  host Timer t1 = new Timer(tick)     // Declare and allocate a timer with a tick() handler

  tick() {
    Led.toggle()                      // Toggle the Led (blink)
  }

  pollen.run() {
    t1.start(500, true)               // Start the timer, 500ms, repeating
    MyBoard.run()                     // Start the event system
  }   
}
    </code></pre>
